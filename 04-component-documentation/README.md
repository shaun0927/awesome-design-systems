## Key Takeaways

- **Show, don't tell—always**: Visual examples are the most powerful teaching tool—every component should lead with a sensitizing example, not paragraphs of explanation
- **Integrate design and code documentation**: Unless you're Material Design scale, splitting design/code docs leads to taxonomy drift and frustrated users—keep them unified on one page
- **Examples in three tiers**: Start with static screenshots (low cost), progress to live example + code pairing (recommended), and only add component explorers (high cost) after 1.0 release
- **Onboarding is your first impression**: Developers should go from zero to "Hello World" component in minutes—skip this and they'll lose confidence in your entire system
- **Documentation is a product, too**: Build reusable doc components (example-code pairs, do/don't patterns, tint stacks) using your own system toolkit—this dogfoods your library and sensitizes your team to user pain points
