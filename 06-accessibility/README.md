## Key Takeaways

- **System accessibility ≠ Product accessibility**: An accessible design system provides a foundation, but adopting teams must still configure, compose, and customize components correctly to achieve truly accessible products
- **Disability affects everyone**: 25% of the global population has disabilities, and temporary conditions (low blood sugar, fatigue, bright sunlight) affect accessibility needs for all users
- **Clear role division is critical**: Document what the system team provides (accessible markup, ARIA properties, WCAG-compliant components) versus what adopting teams must do (proper configuration, composition, custom component accessibility)
- **Education prevents misunderstanding**: Leadership often assumes "system adoption = accessibility achieved" - actively communicate that accessibility is "enabled" not "guaranteed"
- **Practical tools lower barriers**: Card decks and simplified guides make WCAG 2.2 guidelines more accessible to non-experts, turning complex standards into actionable steps
