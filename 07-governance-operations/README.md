## Key Takeaways

- **Central team is non-negotiable**: Zero successful federated-only systems exist across 80+ organizations - a dedicated central team is required, with federated contribution as a supplemental layer
- **Community before governance**: Build collaborative critique culture and shared ownership first, introduce formal governance only when absolutely necessary
- **Support is a critical investment**: Design systems must handle urgent, continuous user requests through structured intake-triage-route-assign-resolve workflows - this requires dedicated resources
- **Systematic task decomposition**: Break work into Step → Phase (START, COMPOSE, TEST, PRESENT, REVIEW, DELIVER) → Subtask hierarchy for predictable, robust outcomes
- **Shared needs over preferences**: Not everything well-made belongs in the system - only widely reusable components justify centralization and maintenance costs
