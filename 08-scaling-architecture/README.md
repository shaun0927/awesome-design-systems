## Key Takeaways

- **Tiered architecture enables scale**: Use 3-tier structure (Core → Feature Sets → Product) with differentiated quality standards - Core demands perfection, lower tiers allow experimentation with promotion paths
- **Scope determines investment**: Team systems need 2-3 months, Portfolio 6-12 months, Enterprise 12-24 months with full-time teams - match ambition to resources or fail
- **Multi-platform requires coordination**: Managing Web/iOS/Android libraries demands careful API alignment, independent releases with collective communication, and clear reference implementations
- **Consolidation needs systematic process**: Map ecosystem first, compare features/outputs/practices, evaluate 4 options (do nothing, share subsystems, build new, keep one), and secure leadership mandate
- **Visual vocabulary clarifies complexity**: Use diamond symbols, design/code notation, and dependency diagrams to quickly communicate system architecture across stakeholders
