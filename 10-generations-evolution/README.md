## Key Takeaways

- **Generations are more than major versions**: A generation affects the entire library, requires significant upgrade effort, involves partner collaboration, triggers backlog review, and slows other work. Only embark on a generation when truly necessary.
- **Plan the full lifecycle upfront**: Strategy → Implementation (Alpha → Beta) → Launch → Deprecation → End of Life. Define clear milestones (Commit, Launch, Deprecation, EOL) and timeline expectations before starting.
- **Enable incremental delivery**: Don't position the system as a single dependency that adopters must wait for. Break it down (colors, typography, spacing, individual components) so teams can start before completion and influence priorities.
- **Understand your adopter types**: Eager ("When can we start?"), Pragmatic ("When must we finish?"), Reluctant ("Do we have to?"), and Individualist ("Can we opt out?"). Tailor communication and support strategies accordingly.
- **Design decisions reflect strategy**: Every homepage, every button, every color choice embodies business priorities, technical constraints, and strategic alignment. Design is not "fuzzy"—it's the physical manifestation of organizational decisions.
